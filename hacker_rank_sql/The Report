You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.
Grades contains the following data:
Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the 
NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher 
grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular 
students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades 
in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by 
their marks in ascending order.


SOLUTION:

SELECT (CASE g.grade>=8 WHEN TRUE THEN s.name ELSE null END),g.grade,s.marks 
FROM students s INNER JOIN grades g ON s.marks BETWEEN min_mark AND max_mark ORDER BY g.grade DESC,s.name,s.marks;

CASE WHEN FUNCTION

JOIN .... ON ....BETWEEN .....

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.


SOLUTION 1:
SELECT MAX(months * salary),COUNT(*) from EMPLOYEE WHERE months * salary = (SELECT MAX(months * salary) FROM EMPLOYEE) ;

SOLUTION2:
select (salary * months)as earnings ,count(*) from employee group by 1 order by earnings desc limit 1;

means - group by first column from SELECT

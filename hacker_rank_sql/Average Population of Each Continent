Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city 
populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

SOLUTION:
SELECT CONTINENT, ROUND(AVG(CITY.POPULATION)-0.5) FROM COUNTRY JOIN CITY ON CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code GROUP BY CONTINENT;


Because we need to round down to the nearest integer,so I do AVG(CITY.POPULATION)-0.5.

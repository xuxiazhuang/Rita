Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.


soluton:

SELECT ceil(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0',''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;


## replace function:The REPLACE() function replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, with a new substring.
REPLACE(string, old_string, new_string)

e.g.
SELECT REPLACE('SQL Tutorial', 'SQL', 'HTML');
HTML Tutorial

## The STUFF() function deletes a part of a string and then inserts another part into the string, starting at a specified position.
STUFF(string, start, length, new_string)
e.g.
SELECT STUFF('SQL Tutorial!', 13, 1, ' is fun!');
SQL Tutorial is fun!

## CEIL The CEIL() function returns the smallest integer value that is bigger than or equal to a number.

e.g.
SELECT CEIL(25.75);
26

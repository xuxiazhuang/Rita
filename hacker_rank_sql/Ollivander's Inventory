Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.

Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age

solution:

select t2.i, t.a, t.c, t.p 
from (select   wp.age a ,min(w.coins_needed) c , max(w.power) p  
from Wands w, Wands_Property wp
where wp.code=w.code and wp.is_evil=0  
group by  wp.age, w.power) as t, 

(select  ww.id i , wpp.age aa , ww.coins_needed cc , ww.power pp 
from Wands ww, Wands_Property wpp
where wpp.code=ww.code and wpp.is_evil=0) as t2 

where t2.aa=t.a and t2.cc=t.c and t2.pp=t.p
order by t.p desc, t.a desc;

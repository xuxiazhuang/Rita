# You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.



Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.


solution:
SELECT N, IF(P IS NULL,'Root',IF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BST WHERE P=B.N)>0,'Inner','Leaf')) FROM BST AS B ORDER BY N;



defination and usage of if:
The IF() function returns a value if a condition is TRUE, or another value if a condition is FALSE.
IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)

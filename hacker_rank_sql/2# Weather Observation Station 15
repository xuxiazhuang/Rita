Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than . Round your answer to  decimal places.

solution1:
select round(LONG_W,4) from station where where LAT_N < 137.2345 order by order by LAT_N desc limit 1;


solution2:
select round(LONG_W,4) from station where LAT_N = (select max(LAT_N) from station where LAT_N < 137.2345);

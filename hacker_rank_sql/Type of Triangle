Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

solution:
select case when A+B > c and b+c > a and a+c>b then
       (CASE WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral' 
         WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles' 
         WHEN A != B OR B != C OR A != C THEN 'Scalene' END )
         else "Not A Triangle"
         END
FROM TRIANGLES;

CASE WHEN:

SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN "The quantity is greater than 30"
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN "The quantity is 30"
    ELSE "The quantity is under 30"
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

The following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country:

SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);

Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than . Round your answer to  decimal places.


SOLUTION 1:
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W, 4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345
ORDER BY LAT_N DESC
LIMIT 1;

SOLUTION2:
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W, 4)FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345);

SOLUTION3:

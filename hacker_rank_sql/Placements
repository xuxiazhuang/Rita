SELECT a.NAME FROM 
(Select s.name,s.ID, p.salary as friend_salary from STUDENTS S JOIN FRIENDS F ON S.ID = F.ID JOIN Packages P on F.FRIEND_ID = P.ID) a join 
(Select S.ID,P.SALARY AS SELF_SALARY FROM STUDENTS S JOIN PACKAGES P ON S.ID = P.ID ) b 
on a.id = b.id
WHERE a.friend_salary > b.self_salary
order by a.friend_salary asc;

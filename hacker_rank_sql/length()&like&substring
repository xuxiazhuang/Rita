# Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names,as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

solution:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY, length(CITY)FROM STATION ORDER BY  length(CITY) DESC LIMIT 1 ;
SELECT DISTINCT CITY, length(CITY)FROM STATION ORDER BY  length(CITY) ASC LIMIT 1 ;


# Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SOLUTION1:
select distinct city from station where city like "A%" or city like "E%" or city like "I%"or city like "O%" or city like "U%";

WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

SOLUTION2:
Select distinct city from station where substring(city,1,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u');

SUBSTRING() function, The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
SUBSTRING(str, pos, len)

SELECT SUBSTRING('w3resource',4,3);
output: eso


# Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

select distinct city from station where left(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u') and right(city,1)
in ('a','e','i','o','u');

The LEFT() function extracts a number of characters from a string (starting from left).
SELECT LEFT("SQL Tutorial", 3) AS ExtractString;
output: SQL


# Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

solution:
select distinct city from station where left(city,1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');


# Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

solution:
select distinct city from station where right(city,1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');

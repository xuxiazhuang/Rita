#union
#The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City

#The following SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and
the "Suppliers" table

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City

SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City

---------------------------------------------------------

#The ANY operator returns true if any of the subquery values meet the condition.

The ALL operator returns true if all of the subquery values meet the condition

SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10)

SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10)



-------------------------------------------------------------
#The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table

SELECT *
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition


#The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.

INSERT INTO SELECT requires that data types in source and target tables match
The existing records in the target table are unaffected

#####The MySQL IFNULL() function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:

SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products

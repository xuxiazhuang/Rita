Between

The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

e.g.
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Genen Shouyu'
ORDER BY ProductName;

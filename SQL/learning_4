####Inserting rows

#Insert statement with values for all columns

insert into mytable
values (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
       (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …)

#Insert statement with specific columns

INSERT INTO mytable
(column, another_column, …)
VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
      (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …)

# Exercises:

#Add the studio's new production, Toy Story 4 to the list of movies (you can use any director)

insert into Movies values ("Toy Story 4","John Lasseter")

# Toy Story 4 has been released to critical acclaim! It had a rating of 8.7,
# and made 340 million domestically and 270 million internationally. Add the record to the  BoxOffice table

insert into Boxoffice (Rating,Domestic_sales,International_sales)
values (8.7,340000000,270000000)

#Updating rows

# Update statement with values

update mytable
set column = value_or_expr, other_column = another_value_or_expr
where condition


#always write the constraint first and test it in a SELECT query to make sure you are updating the right rows


#Exercise:

#The director for A Bug's Life is incorrect, it was actually directed by John Lasseter
update Moviea
set director = "John Lasseter"
where title = "A Bug's Life"

#The year that Toy Story 2 was released is incorrect, it was actually released in 1999
update Movies
set year = 1999
where title = "Toy Story 2"

#Both the title and directory for Toy Story 8 is incorrect! The title should be "Toy Story 3" and it was directed by Lee Unkrich
#update Movies
set title = "Toy Story 3",director = "Lee Unkrich"
where id = 11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Delete statement with condition

DELETE FROM mytable
WHERE condition

#This database is getting too big, lets remove all movies that were released before 2005
delete from Movies
where year < 2005

#Andrew Stanton has also left the studio, so please remove all movies directed by him.

delete from Movies
where director = "Andrew Stanton"

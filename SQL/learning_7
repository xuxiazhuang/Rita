#SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of the query

#aliase column syntax
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name

aliase table syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name

Example:

SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers

#The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country)
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers

######aliase for table 

SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName="Around the Horn" AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID

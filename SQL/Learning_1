#Find the movies released in the years between 2000 and 2010

#Filtering and sorting Query results

#Select query with unique results

select distinct column,another_column,........from mytable
where condition(s)

#SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column
#Select query with ordered results

select column,another_column,....from mytable
where condition(s)
order by column asc/desc

#The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.

select column,another_column,....from mytable
where condition(s)
order by column asc/desc
limit num_list offset num_offset

excises:
#List all directors of Pixar movies (alphabetically), without duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT Director From Movies
ORDER BY director ASC

#List the last four Pixar movies released (ordered from most recent to least)

SELECT Title,Year From Movies
ORDER BY Year DESC
LIMIT 4

#List the first five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically

SELECT Title FROM movies
ORDER BY Title ASC
LIMIT 5


#List the next five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically
SELECT Title FROM movies
ORDER BY Title ASC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5
